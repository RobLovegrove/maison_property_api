# Property API Development Roadmap

## Next Steps
1. Database Integration
   - [✓] Set up PostgreSQL database
   - [✓] Create property table schema
   - [✓] Add SQLAlchemy ORM
   - [✓] Migrate sample data to database
   - [✓] Update endpoints to use database
   - [✓] Enhance property model with detailed fields
   - [✓] Set up automatic database migrations

2. Property Management Endpoints
   - [✓] Add POST endpoint for creating properties
   - [✓] Add PUT endpoint for updating properties
   - [✓] Add DELETE endpoint for removing properties
   - [✓] Add validation for property data
   - [ ] Add authentication for management endpoints

3. Image Handling
   - [ ] Set up cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage)
   - [✓] Add image upload functionality
   - [ ] Add image resize/optimization
   - [ ] Add support for multiple property images
   - [ ] Add image deletion when property is deleted

4. Search and Filter Improvements
   - [ ] Add location-based search
   - [ ] Add price range filtering
   - [ ] Add property features filtering
   - [ ] Add sorting options (price, date added, etc.)
   - [ ] Add fuzzy search for addresses

5. API Optimization
   - [ ] Add pagination for property listings
   - [ ] Add response caching
   - [ ] Add request rate limiting
   - [ ] Add response compression
   - [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

6. Frontend Integration
   - [✓] Add CORS support
   - [ ] Add API authentication
   - [ ] Add request logging
   - [ ] Add error tracking
   - [ ] Add API versioning

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add user accounts and favorites
- [ ] Add property viewing scheduling
- [ ] Add property analytics (views, favorites, etc.)
- [ ] Add email notifications
- [ ] Add real-time updates
- [ ] Add property comparison feature

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
- [✓] Add comprehensive test suite for API endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add performance tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add backup strategy
- [ ] Add security scanning

## Notes
- Priority should be given to database integration and basic CRUD operations
- Image handling should be implemented before going to production
- Frontend team will need CORS support and API documentation
- Virtual environment is named `.venv` and should be activated before running the application
- PostgreSQL setup on macOS requires:
  1. `brew install postgresql@14 libpq`
  2. Add libpq to PATH
  3. `brew services start postgresql@14`
  4. `createuser -s postgres`
  5. `createdb property_db`
